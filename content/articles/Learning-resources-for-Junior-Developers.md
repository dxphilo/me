In this article, we are going to look into some of the best resources to get you started as a Junior Developer.

Being a developer you feel like you have a bunch of things to cover and learn and with so many technologies it is not quite easy to know it all.

This article will act as a guide and provide you with a background to get you started as a junior developer.
Know the basics of programming.

I would suggest to start with the basics and try out:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Though you can start with any language of your choice if you are stuck in making a choice I would suggest that. This is my own sincere opinion though.

Decide on what you want to dive into:
- Frontend
- Backend
- Machine Learning
- Data Science
- Game Development
- Mobile applications


Software engineering is a vast field ranging from frontend/backend/Full Stack/Machine Learning/Data Science/Game Development.

My humble opinion to any junior developer starting is to pick a specific niche rather than going all head. Pick a field that you feel comfortable with and kick start your journey.
Where to Start.

1. **Boot Camps**



Programming Boot camps offer a good professional background to get you started with the right mentoring and coaching. It also ensures that you work on a real-life project that will help you understand what it takes to start and finish projects.

Most boot camps are paid but if you do not have the cash for it I would suggest some other best resources.

2. **Internship Programs**



Internship programs are great in kickstarting your developer journey. Most internships offer you with a senior mentor to guide you through and give you frequent progress checks.

On top of that, you will also be exposed to developing real-world projects and applications that will supercharge your development career. 

These programs may also offer you with potential job opportunities.

3) **YouTube**



YouTube has so many and vast video resources and tutorial guides to get you started pretty quick. Depending on your niche and technology stack there are thousands of tutorial guides at your disposal.

To ensure not being stuck in tutorial “hell” as I always term it, it is better to pick one tutorial and only after finishing it should you move to the next. This will help improve your productivity as well as your skills.

I have also benefited so much from “YouTube University” as I call it and much of what I know now is what I leant from there.

To help other junior developers out there I have a channel dedicated to junior out there where I share some guide and tutorials for junior developers.

4. **FreecodeCamp**



Freecodecamp is a free platform that offers you free programming lessons. What you need is to only create an account on the platform and start. 

What’s good about this platform is that they also give you projects at the end of every course to test and improve your skills.

With a dedicated person if you finish their curriculum I am sure you will be a better developer. On top of that, they also provide you with the best article and blog tutorials to help you on your way.

Upon completion of their curriculum, you will be provided by certificates after completion. They’re also a tone of other best websites that provide you with free coding classes and guides.

**Conclusion**



Starting as a junior can be a bit frustrating with so many things to learn and you can get stuck in choosing where to start. You can leverage and start with the above-mentioned resources.

Also to note that all these resources are a great way to start but the key to personal improvement is through practice. Remember they say practice makes perfect, yes that’s it.

Also to note that I have a YouTube channel dedicated entirely to junior developers, how about you check it out here.
